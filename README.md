# Opentelemetry demo gitops

This repository contains Helm chart for [Astroshop](https://github.com/Dynatrace/opentelemetry-demo), an adaptation of the [Opentelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo) app, alongside with:

- sample deployment script
- [Argocd](./flagd/README.md) configuration used to showcase Dynatrace's ability to monitor gitops
- a small internal admin UI for proposing `flagd` feature-flag changes through GitHub

## Deployment

### Requirements

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) >= 3.18
- [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/) >= 5.7
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- Dynatrace tenant

### Prerequisites

To properly function the Astroshop deployment requires a few other tools to be present on the cluster, however since they are not a part of the Astroshop itself, they are not included in the helm chart and have to be installed separately. We provide sample deployments but you can install them however you see fit or use already existing ones.

#### Dynatrace operator

To monitor the cluster with Dynatrace you can follow the official [guide](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/setup-on-k8s/deployment/full-stack-observability) or use the sample [deployment](./config/dt-operator/README.md)

#### Ingress controller [optional]

If you want to deploy the ingress resources (by setting `components.ingress.enabled: true` in values) you will need the ingress controller running on the cluster. If you already have one running make sure that it's properly instrumented. Sample installation info [here](./config/ingress/README.md)

### Helm deployment

To deploy the helm chart you will first need to set the required values in a local override file.

Use [kustomize/base/values.yaml](./kustomize/base/values.yaml) as the checked-in template and create a local `kustomize/base/values.local.yaml` file with your real environment-specific values. The local file is ignored by git and loaded after `values.yaml` during deployment.

You can check the possible values [here](./charts/astroshop/values.yaml)

- _components.dt-credentials.tenantEndpoint_ - tenant url including the `/api/v2/otlp`, e.g. **https://wkf10640.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp**
- _components.dt-credentials.tenantToken_ - access token using the `Kubernetes: Data Ingest` template

Example `kustomize/base/values.local.yaml`:

```yaml
components:
  dt-credentials:
    tenantEndpoint: https://wkf10640.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp
    tenantToken: dt0c01.abc.xxx
  flag-admin-ui:
    authUsername: admin
    authPassword: "change-me"
    githubToken: ghp_xxx
```

then run

```bash
./deploy
```

#### Overlays

If you want to deploy a version with extra features can use one of the overlays or create your own

> **NOTE:** the extra components being deployed may require extra configuration, refer to their READMEs to check what data needs to be provided

```bash
./deploy {overlay-name}
```

##### AWS lambda image provider

You can read more about it [here](./image-provider/)

Once you've deployed the infrastructure you need to take the lambda url and set it in the [env file](./kustomize/components/image-provider/data.env)

### Flag admin UI

The deployment also includes an internal admin UI at `/admin` for supported `flagd` feature toggles.

Set the `components.flag-admin-ui` values in `kustomize/base/values.local.yaml` and the deploy script will generate the `flag-admin-ui-secrets` Secret automatically during deployment.

If the admin password contains YAML-special characters such as `#` or `:`, wrap it in quotes.

The UI:

- reads `kustomize/components/flagd-config/demo.flagd.json` from your fork
- allows trusted admins to toggle supported boolean scenarios
- creates or updates a PR on the `admin/flag-toggles` branch instead of mutating the live cluster directly

# Flagd configuration change: problem patterns

## About

ArgoCD monitors the directory under the application called **opentelemetry-demo-flagd-config**. After each modification, ArgoCD synchronizes the data and applies the changes. The goal of this configuration is to switch the feature flags state of OpenTelemetry demo configuration, which in effect enables or disables problem patterns

## Purpose of configuration files

Flagd stores feature flag states in a ConfigMap. To toggle a problem pattern, the value of the flag needs to be updated. Flagd itself doesn't detect manual changes in the ConfigMap, to apply changes Flagd need to be restarted. To facilitate this, a job has been added that restarts Flagd after a feature flag change.

## Configuration

`flagd-config.yaml` contains ConfigMap with feature flag states

To toggle flag, change value of **defaultVariant** to either **on** or **off**.

```json
"productCatalogFailure": {
    "description": "Fail product catalog service on a specific product",
    "state": "ENABLED",
    "variants": {
        "on": true,
        "off": false
    },
    "defaultVariant": "off"
}
```

`flagd-restart.yaml` contains job restarting flagd

Job is tagged as ArgoCD hook, which is triggered automatically after succesful sync and deleted afterward.

```yaml
annotations:
  #  triggers hook after sync
  argocd.argoproj.io/hook: PostSync
  #  deletes hook resourcers after successful deployment
  argocd.argoproj.io/hook-delete-policy: HookSucceeded
```
